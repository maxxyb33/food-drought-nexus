## Proposal
### for GEOG4/572 project

# World Food-Drought Nexus #

*Group members:* 
**Bryce Bradshaw, Murthy Ganti, Max Boath**

*The motives:*
1. Look at world cereal production and trade (isolines, size-dependent)
2. Compare visually to drought history
3. Projection into future possible outcomes based on data
4. Determine what is the maximum population that can be supported by food consumption; has population been keeping pace with food production?
5. JS code that will do something with the data -- not just show it, but process it too, do some computation/optimization with the data


*A description of the project:*
⋅⋅⋅Our map-based website will track 5 cereal food crop products’ movement around the world.  We will use data from FAO to feed a migration map (imports and exports by country, per crop), with an overarching coordinated-view that links active clicks to graphs of the data.  An underlying heatmap layer of drought-affected areas will tie food production/consumption to climatic events, and to see how the situation has evolved over time, we will apply a time-slider to our map.  Lastly, we hope to find a way to optimize the data on the fly, so that the website not only shows historical, recorded data, but may also be able to project trends into the future.
